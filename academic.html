        <p> Internal Communications is extremely important to an organizations success and it is quickly becoming one of the important specializations of the public relations profession. Internal communications can be defined as “the communication flow among people within the boundary of an organization” (Mazzei, A., 2010, p. 221). Mazzei (2010) states that other scholars have noted the importance of internal communication because it can cause a positive external image or reputation and is a relationship management and commitment building function. These are important elements to an organizations success and the ability to improve them with internal communications causes this area to be an asset in any organization. </p>    
        
        <p>Although internal communications is seen as an asset within an organization, there are often problems in deciding in which department the function belongs. According to a study conducted by Vercic, A. T. et al. (2012) many areas are viewed as close to internal communications including human resources, change management, organization development, public relations, marketing and general management, corporate human resources, corporate strategy and corporate communications. The wide array of disciplines that internal communications can fall under could cause problems for the specialization in an organization. Most importantly because two departments could decide that they are responsible for the function and create an unnecessary amount of information flow to employees and sometimes create a power struggle between two departments. For this reason, Vercic (2012) calls for a creation of a specific department in organizations relating to internal communications. This distinction would help to better understand the function of internal communications and help internal communicators to successfully complete their job functions. </p>

        <p>Scholars have also researched the impact that internal communications can have on employee job satisfaction. This is extremely important to an organization because, often, happy employees create more success for an organization. Nikolic, M. et al. (2013) discovered that increase in communication satisfaction with supervisor is accompanied by the increase in the satisfaction with a supervisor and that personal feedback is the most influential communication satisfaction dimension. These two findings are important to our conversation of internal communications because it confirms that internal communication is a necessary function in creating employee satisfaction within an organization. </p>
            
        <p>As internal communications continues to grow as an important function for an organizations success the continued study by scholars will be important to it’s growth. Scholarly theory is important to support the practice put in place by practitioners and the study of internal communications will need to be expanded if this practice continues moving towards the development of a specialization in the communications field. </p>
