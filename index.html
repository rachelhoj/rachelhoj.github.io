            <p>I graduated with a Master of Arts in Mass Communication with a specialization in public relations from the University of Florida on May 2, 2014. My undergraduate experience was spent at The Ohio State University where I received a degree in strategic communications. The experience I’ve had at these universities academically and socially have helped shape me into the person I am today.</p>

<p>I had no idea I wanted to study public relations when I started college. My undergraduate major changed from pre-design to marketing, until I finally settled on strategic communications. The few classes I took focusing solely on public relations had me interested but it took me a while to realize that is what I needed to be doing. After I realized public relations was what I wanted to be doing, I decided to apply to the University of Florida’s public relations graduate program and go back to school.</p>

<p>Which brings me to this website. During my last semester at UF I took a semester long course where I was taught HTML and CSS. By the end of the semester I was required to have this website up and running using everything I learned in class. Not only is this site my portfolio it also shows a new skill I learned in those three months. This was my first attempt at a website but I’ve had lots of experience writing articles, press releases, creating communication plans, event planning, conducting research, developing creative material and managing social media accounts. Take a look around and let me know what you think. </p>

<ul class="left">
    <li class="bullet">Living in Perugia, Italy for three months in 2008 was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had. I wish that I could go back every day.

    <li class="bullet">
If I’m not at the gym once a day I’m not a happy person. I love lifting heavy and staying active. 
    </li>
    <li class= "bullet">My mom always told me that everyone should be a server at least once in his or her life; I decided to be a bartender for a few years instead. It’s cliché to say but that job taught me a lot about life.

    <li class="bullet">During my last semester at the University of Florida, I was a guest cover star on Casey Prather's regional Sports Illustrated cover. Go Gators!</li>
