            <p>I graduated with a Master of Arts in Mass Communication with a specialization in public relations from the University of Florida on May 2, 2014. My undergraduate experience was spent at The Ohio State University where I received a degree in strategic communications. The experience that I have had at these universities academically and socially have helped shape me into the person I am today.</p>

<p>I did not start my educational journey knowing that I wanted to practice public relations in my adult life. My undergraduate major changed from pre-design to marketing, until I finally settled on strategic communications. The few classes I took focusing solely on public relations had me interested in pursuing it as a profession. I had only a small working knowledge of what public relations was so I decided to apply to the University of Floridaâ€™s public relations graduate program.</p>

<p>This website is my first attempt at HTML and CSS. The final product that you see here was conceptualized and completed during a three-month period. During this time, I learned what HTML and CSS are and coded for the first time in my life. Although this website is utilized as an online portfolio of sorts, it is also a product and showcases a new skill I learned during my last semester at the University of Florida.</p>
            
<p>My professional and educational experience includes writing press releases and articles, creating strategic public relations plans, event planning, conducting research studies, developing creative material and managing social media accounts.</p>

    CrossFit is my latest athletic endeavor. Belonging to a CrossFit gym reminds me of the teams I joined in high school and is a lesson in discipline and dedication every time I walk in the door.
