            <p>I am currently pursuing a Masters of Arts in Mass Communication with a specialization in public relations at the University of Florida and will be graduating on May 2, 2014. My undergraduate experience was spent at The Ohio State University where I received a degree in strategic communications. The experience that I have had at these universities academically and socially have helped shape me into the person I am today. </p>

<p>After spending two years studying visual communication design in high school, I started my college journey with a dream to become a graphic designer and work for a big New York magazine. I quickly came to realize that sitting at a computer all day was not for me. Interacting with others and having the opportunity to participate in many different activities during the workday interested me much more. This realization led me to the communications world and oh what a journey it has been.</p>

<p>My professional and educational experience includes writing press releases and articles, creating strategic public relations plans, event planning, conducting research studies, developing creative material and managing social media accounts.</p>

<p>Personal level:

    <li class="bullet">Living in Perugia, Italy for three months in 2008 was a life changing experience and helped me grow into the person I am today.

    CrossFit is my latest athletic endeavor. Belonging to a CrossFit box reminds me of the teams I joined in high school and is a lesson in discipline and dedication every time I walk into the box. 
    </li>
    <li class= "bullet">In between my undergraduate and graduate experience, I spent a few years working as a server and bartender. This humbling experience taught me a lot about others and the best way to positively interact with them.
