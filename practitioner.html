        <p>Practitioners communicate the importance of internal communications often. It seems as if the academic world has some catching up to do if they are to support the growing trend of this topic as a public relations specialization. Practitioners are also always exploring different and interesting ways to communicate to their internal audiences. </p>
        <p>Much like the public relations profession, internal communications has their own professional association, Institute for Internal Communications. In my analysis of the academic point of view of internal communications I mentioned that the creation of a specific department within an organization for internal communications will be important to the success of the specialization. It seems as if practitioners themselves are working towards making this happen by establishing professional associations dedicated to perfecting their craft.</p>
        <p>The Institute of Internal Communications defines internal communications as “an enabling function – it makes your organization work” (Why is IC important, n.d.). This definition seems to create internal communications as a necessity in all organizations. Essentially it is because as the Institute of Internal Communications states there is a “proven link between highly effective organizations and good internal communications” (Why is IC important, n.d.). </p>
    <p>An interesting trend in internal communication is the use of social media to communicate with employees. Rachel Miller, an internal communications specialist and author of the blog All Things IC, conceptualized four theories about how internal communicators use social media: “social networks often just appear within organizations”, “internal communication pros are expected to have a good understanding of social media”, “social networks are put in place without understanding why”, and “internal comms pros learn about social media via blogs and colleagues” (Miller, 2013). Miller then conducted a survey to confirm or deny her theories about social media use in internal communications. She discovered that her thoughts agreed with her results. Internal communicators are using social media to communicate with their publics, often through internal social networks like Yammer, Snapcomms and Sharepoint. Although internal communicators use these internal social networks, they are often familiar with and use the social media for their job daily, thus confirming another one of Miller’s theories (Miller, 2013). </p>

        <p>PR Daily recently compiled a list of “communication trends you’d be crazy to ignore”, the entries most surprising are gamification and print. Creating games to reach employees and internal audiences is a extremely innovative concept and one that would be interesting to see in practice. Gamification is often used in training programs but Holtz (2013) believes that communicators can use this tactic to influence their audiences consume internal communication and provide the communicators with feedback. Interestingly, print was included on the list of communications trends. Holtz (2013) believes that companies reduced their use of this medium because of budget cuts. In the coming year print will become a trend in those companies whose employees do not always have access to the intranet and need information (Holtz, 2013). Although costly, the reason many companies got rid of print in the first place, this will help all of the employees be informed of changes and important information even if they do not have access to the intranet. </p>
        <p>Internal communications is a developing area in the communications world. The development of an academic body of knowledge and professional associations will help this profession grow. Until then the practitioners will continue using innovative strategies in their communication and testing the theories and trends they see in their profession.</p>
